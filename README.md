- It is a programming techniques that break down the problems into sub-problems.
- why we used this problems? - because its depend on choices and decisions.
- There are steps which needs to follow :
  1) we take choices for making subsets and take decision.. which one choose or not.
  2) not focus on doing smaller the inputs... it will automatically done by taking decision.
  3) making Recursive Tree ...
  {here you have done half of the problems}
